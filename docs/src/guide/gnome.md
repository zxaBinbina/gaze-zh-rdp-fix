# GNOME Extension

Gaze's lock screen and GDM integrations are specific to GNOME and are provided
by the `gaze-gnome-extension` package. The one-line installer tries to enable
lock screen face unlock for your current GNOME user. If you install packages
manually, you will need to enable the extension yourself. On openSUSE Tumbleweed,
first install it with `sudo zypper install gaze-gnome-extension`.

This extension starts the `gdm-face` PAM service inside GNOME Shell authentication flows. It supports GNOME Shell 45 through 51.

The extension is only needed for GNOME's lock screen and GDM flows. The CLI, GUI,
and regular PAM prompts such as `sudo` work without it; if you use another desktop,
you can leave the GNOME extension disabled.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you enable `require_confirmation_lock_screen = true` or `require_confirmation_elevation = true` in `/etc/gaze/config.toml`, this GNOME Shell Extension **must** be enabled for face-authorization confirmation to function inside GNOME's graphical PolKit prompts and on the lock screen / GDM login screen.
>
> GNOME's prompts normally won't let you confirm with an empty password field. When Gaze asks for confirmation, the extension hides that field and focuses the **Authenticate** button in PolKit. On the lock screen and GDM login screen, it adds a **Confirm Face Unlock** button.
>
> If the extension is **inactive/disabled** under GNOME while either toggle is set, Gaze's PAM modules will **safely bypass confirmation** (returning success instantly upon face match) to prevent empty input hangs and user lockouts.

## Should I enable it?

If you use GNOME and want face unlock on the lock screen, enable the extension.

Otherwise, you can leave it disabled: it is not needed for CLI or GUI enrollment,
regular PAM authentication, or desktops other than GNOME.

## Enable the extension

After installing the package, reboot so GNOME Shell can discover the extension.
Once you are back in your GNOME session, enable it with:

```bash
gnome-extensions enable gaze@gundulabs.com
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.gaze enable-face-authentication true
```

`gnome-extensions enable` will report `Extension "gaze@gundulabs.com" does not exist` if you run it before rebooting. Shell only scans extension directories at session start, so running the command immediately after install (without a session restart) always fails. If you cannot reboot yet, the equivalent dconf write works at any time and takes effect on the next login:

```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.shell enabled-extensions \
  "$(gsettings get org.gnome.shell enabled-extensions | sed "s/]\$/, 'gaze@gundulabs.com']/; s/^@as \[\]\$/['gaze@gundulabs.com']/")"
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.gaze enable-face-authentication true
```

### The extension disappears again after a logout

Adding the UUID by hand names an extension the running GNOME Shell has never scanned. Shell drops UUIDs it does not recognise the next time it rewrites `enabled-extensions`, which it does when the session ends or when you toggle any other extension. So the setting can look correct right after install and be gone after the first logout, without anything having failed.

Reboot rather than log out after installing, so Shell scans the extension before it rewrites the list.

If it has already vanished, run the two commands under [Enable the extension](#enable-the-extension) from a GNOME session that started **after** the package was installed. `gaze doctor` reports this case as `GNOME extension: installed, but not enabled for the current user` and prints the same steps.

The one-line installer also leaves a one-shot autostart entry, `~/.config/autostart/gaze-gnome-enable.desktop`, that re-applies the enable at your next GNOME login and then deletes itself along with its helper at `~/.local/share/gaze/gnome-enable.sh`. Both are safe to delete by hand if you would rather do it yourself.

## Open the extension preferences

```bash
gnome-extensions prefs gaze@gundulabs.com
```

Or open the **Extensions** app (Extension Manager works too), find **Gaze**, and open its settings from the row.

The window has a single **Behavior** page with two groups:

| Group | Contains |
|---|---|
| **Face authentication** | `Enable face authentication (lock screen)`, `Face retry mode`, `Maximum face tries`. Applies to this session's lock screen only. |
| **GDM login screen** | `Enable face auth at GDM login`. Applies to the login screen and asks for admin authorization. |

## Retry behavior

The extension decides how many times face authentication is retried within one
authentication cycle. Both settings live under **Behavior → Face authentication**
in the extension preferences, and both are per dconf profile, so GDM and your
desktop session can differ.

| Setting | dconf key | Values | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| Face retry mode | `face-retry-mode` | `disabled`, `fixed`, `infinite` | `fixed` |
| Maximum face tries | `max-face-tries` | 2 to 20 | 3 |

- `disabled`: one attempt. After it fails, face auth stops for that cycle and you
  finish with your password.
- `fixed`: retries until `max-face-tries` failures, then stops for that cycle.
- `infinite`: keeps retrying for as long as the prompt is open. The password entry
  stays usable throughout.

`max-face-tries` only applies in `fixed` mode, and the extension clamps it to a
minimum of 2 even if dconf holds a lower value.

From a terminal:

```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.gaze face-retry-mode infinite
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.gaze max-face-tries 5
```

To set these for the GDM login screen, write them into the same
`/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/99-gaze` override described below and run `sudo dconf update`.

## Create a face profile

Enrollment does not live in the extension preferences. Use the Gaze settings app or the CLI:

```bash
gaze-gui             # Faces list, press + to enroll
gaze add-face default
```

The profile name defaults to `default`, matching the CLI quick-start flow. Follow the camera prompts until the profile is saved.

## Login warning (GNOME keyring)

GDM loads the extension from package defaults, but face authentication for the GDM login screen is disabled by default.

This is mostly about GNOME keyring behavior. GNOME keyring is normally unlocked by your login password. If you log in with face only, that password is never entered, so the keyring may stay locked.

When that happens, apps that read saved secrets (browser credentials, git credentials, Wi-Fi secrets, chat clients, etc.) can keep prompting for a keyring password until you unlock it manually.

### Optional TPM-backed keyring unlock

Enable TPM template encryption, liveness, and GNOME Keyring unlock in `gaze config`.
Then enroll the login keyring password:

```bash
gaze keyring
```

The password is stored in a root-only TPM-protected record. It is not sent over
DBus. Re-enroll it after changing the account or keyring password.

On SELinux systems (Fedora, and openSUSE Tumbleweed installs made since early
2025) the GDM session worker is confined and cannot read `/etc/shadow` or the
TPM, both of which the unlock needs. `gaze keyring` loads the
`gaze-greeter-keyring` policy module to allow this, and `sudo gaze doctor`
reports it as **Keyring SELinux policy**.

To remove the stored record, run `gaze keyring --forget`. `gaze clear-user` also
removes it. An administrator can act on another account with
`sudo gaze keyring --user <name>`.

Enable [GDM face login](#optional-enable-face-at-gdm-login) separately. If you
maintain your own `gdm-face` file, use this auth order, and keep the session line:

```pam
auth    required   pam_env.so
auth    [success=1 default=ignore] pam_gaze.so
auth    requisite  pam_deny.so
auth    optional   pam_gnome_keyring.so use_authtok

session optional   pam_gnome_keyring.so auto_start
```

The auth hook saves the token; the `session` hook starts and unlocks the keyring. This only works with `pam_gaze.so` in its default sequential mode; the
`simultaneous` option does not supply the token.

Gaze sets `PAM_AUTHTOK` only after face and liveness authentication succeeds. If
the TPM, record, or password binding is unavailable, GDM falls back to the normal
password login. A user who has not run `gaze keyring` logs in normally and is
prompted for the keyring as before. Clearing the TPM, or changing the account
password, requires re-enrollment. Gaze cannot verify the keyring password during
enrollment or detect a later keyring-only password change: an incorrect or stale
password leaves the keyring locked and requires a manual unlock and re-enrollment.

### What this changes about your security

Before enabling keyring unlock, review these security implications.

- **The record is recoverable by root on this machine.** Sealing has no PCR
  policy, so anyone who can run code as root here, including someone who boots
  another OS from a USB stick against an unencrypted disk, can unseal the key
  and recover the plaintext password. It protects a *stolen disk*, not a machine
  someone else can boot. Enable full-disk encryption if that matters to you.
- **The password becomes visible to the rest of the `gdm-face` stack.** Once
  `PAM_AUTHTOK` is set, every later module in that service can read it, including
  the distribution-managed `postlogin`, `system-auth` and `common-session`
  includes. Linux-PAM wipes it when the service ends.
- **Face becomes equivalent to your password at the login screen.** Without this
  option a face login gives an attacker a desktop session; with it, it also gives
  them everything in your keyring.

### Upgrading from an earlier Gaze

`/etc/pam.d/gdm-face` is preserved across package upgrades, so an existing
install keeps the stack that predates this feature and the unlock silently never
happens. Run `sudo gaze doctor`: it reports the stale file and how to replace it.

## Optional: enable face at GDM login

The easiest way is the **Enable face auth at GDM login** switch, under **Behavior → GDM login screen** in the [extension preferences](#open-the-extension-preferences). Toggling it triggers a polkit prompt, then the daemon writes `/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/99-gaze` and runs `dconf update` for you.

Reboot to apply. Restarting GDM also works, but it immediately logs out active desktop sessions.

```bash
sudo reboot
```

### Manual alternative

If you prefer to do it from a terminal:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/99-gaze >/dev/null <<'EOF'
[org/gnome/shell/extensions/gaze]
enable-face-authentication=true
EOF
sudo dconf update
```

At the GDM login screen, Gaze still matches against the selected user's enrolled faces, capturing the kernel camera device directly rather than through any user's PipeWire session: while the greeter owns the seat, the attempt is bound to the selected user, so a session lingering in the background (after a logout or user switch) cannot supply its own camera stream.

## Disable face at GDM login

Flip the **Enable face auth at GDM login** switch back off under **Behavior → GDM login screen**, or remove the override manually:

```bash
sudo rm -f /etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/99-gaze*
sudo dconf update
```

## Nothing appears at the GDM login screen

If the lock screen works but the login screen never offers face auth, and the GDM
journal shows nothing, check whether the greeter has extensions switched off:

```bash
sudo env DCONF_PROFILE=gdm XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/var/lib/gdm/seat0/config \
  gsettings get org.gnome.shell disable-user-extensions
```

`true` means GNOME Shell stops its whole extension system in the greeter, so Gaze
never loads there however it is configured. GDM's own dconf database holds the key
and outranks every keyfile Gaze installs under `/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d`, so clear it
at the source and reboot:

```bash
sudo rm -f /var/lib/gdm/seat0/config/dconf/user
```

GDM writes the file again with its own defaults. On Debian and Ubuntu the path is
under `/var/lib/gdm3`, and a machine with more than one seat has one directory per
seat. `gaze doctor` reports this and names the file for you.

## Verify GNOME flow

- Lock screen, then try unlock with face.
- If login face auth is enabled, test a full logout/login cycle.

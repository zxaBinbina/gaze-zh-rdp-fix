# PAM

Use this guide to set up face authentication for `sudo`, polkit, and shared PAM stacks.

`gaze auth` is a useful first check for the daemon and camera, but it does not
test the PAM stack itself.

If you specifically want GNOME lock screen or GDM login behavior, use the [GNOME Extension guide](/guide/gnome).

## What Gaze installs

- `pam_gaze.so` (supports sequential, simultaneous, and retry modes)

`pam_gaze_grosshack.so` also still ships on openSUSE as a compatibility shim for
old configurations. It is deprecated, prints a notice on every authentication,
and will be removed; it does nothing that `pam_gaze.so simultaneous` does not.

In sequential mode (the default), Gaze tries face authentication first and then
falls back to the password prompt. With the `simultaneous` option (for example,
`pam_gaze.so simultaneous`), face authentication and the password prompt run at
the same time. The `retry` option (for example, `pam_gaze.so retry`) adds a
second Gaze entry *below* the password module, giving face authentication one
more chance after a rejected password. See
[Retry after a rejected password](#retry-after-a-rejected-password).

### Network logins are skipped

A camera attached to this machine cannot see whoever is at the other end of a
network login, so Gaze steps aside for them. When the calling service sets
`PAM_RHOST` to anything other than loopback, `pam_gaze.so` returns `PAM_IGNORE`
immediately and the stack falls through to the next module, normally the
password check. Services that authenticate remote clients set this item:
`sshd`, `dovecot`, `vsftpd`, and Samba among them.

This matters on Debian and Ubuntu, where enabling a Gaze profile through
`pam-auth-update` puts Gaze in `common-auth`, and `common-auth` is included by
nearly every service on the system, not just the desktop ones. Those services
keep authenticating by password exactly as before.

## Debian / Ubuntu

Packages install PAM profiles for `pam-auth-update`.

Apply or re-apply them:

```bash
sudo pam-auth-update --package
```

Pick one of the Gaze entries, then test with a real PAM prompt:

```bash
sudo -v
```

If camera opens and face auth runs, PAM wiring is active.

### Selective setup: password at GDM, face authentication for sudo and Polkit

On GNOME systems, some users may want to keep password authentication at
the initial GDM login so that GNOME Keyring is unlocked normally (see
[Login warning](/guide/gnome#login-warning-gnome-keyring)), while still using
Gaze for privilege elevation and graphical Polkit prompts.

Enabling the Debian/Ubuntu Gaze profile through `pam-auth-update` adds Gaze to
the shared `common-auth` stack. Because `gdm-password` also includes
`common-auth`, this may make Gaze run during the initial desktop login.

The following setup was manually verified on Ubuntu 26.04 with GNOME 50.

::: warning
PAM configuration errors can prevent authentication. Keep an active root
shell open, keep password authentication enabled, and create backups before
editing these files.
:::

First disable the shared Gaze profiles:

```bash
sudo pam-auth-update --disable gaze gaze-simultaneous gaze-retry
```

`--disable` (rather than `--remove`) records the choice, so the
`pam-auth-update --package` call in the Gaze package's post-install script will
not re-enable the profile on the next upgrade.

Verify that Gaze is no longer present in the shared stack:

```bash
grep -n pam_gaze /etc/pam.d/common-auth \
  || echo "Gaze is not enabled in common-auth"
```

Keep the GDM face-login switch disabled. The switch lives in the Gaze extension
preferences (see
[Disable face at GDM login](/guide/gnome#disable-face-at-gdm-login)); the daemon
writes the override below when it is on, so remove it if it is already present:

```bash
sudo rm -f /etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/99-gaze*
sudo dconf update
```

#### sudo

Back up `/etc/pam.d/sudo`, then add this line immediately before
`@include common-auth`:

```text
auth    sufficient    pam_gaze.so
```

The relevant part should look like:

```text
auth    sufficient    pam_gaze.so
@include common-auth
```

Test it with:

```bash
sudo -k
sudo -v
```

The same change can be applied to `/etc/pam.d/sudo-i` if face authentication
is also wanted for `sudo -i`.

Both files are dpkg conffiles, so a `sudo` package upgrade may prompt about the
local modification. Keep the modified version to retain face authentication.

#### Polkit

If `/etc/pam.d/polkit-1` does not exist but the vendor file is available,
create a local override:

```bash
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0644 \
  /usr/lib/pam.d/polkit-1 \
  /etc/pam.d/polkit-1
```

Add the following line immediately before `@include common-auth`:

```text
auth    sufficient    pam_gaze.so
```

Restart Polkit and test a graphical authentication request:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart polkit
pkexec /usr/bin/true
```

A file in `/etc/pam.d` shadows the vendor file permanently, so this override
will not pick up upstream changes to the Polkit stack. Diff it against
`/usr/lib/pam.d/polkit-1` after Polkit upgrades.

Finally, confirm Gaze still sees a live PAM wiring. `gaze doctor` scans every
file in `/etc/pam.d`, so a per-service setup satisfies its PAM check:

```bash
gaze doctor
```

With this arrangement:

- GDM login uses the normal account password.
- GNOME Keyring is unlocked during login.
- `sudo` and `sudo -i` can use face authentication.
- GNOME Settings, package-management applications, and other Polkit clients
  can use face authentication.
- The GNOME extension can remain enabled for face unlock on the lock screen.
- Password authentication remains available as a fallback.

## Fedora and compatible RPM systems

RPM packages install an authselect profile at:

`/usr/share/authselect/vendor/gaze`

The profile adds Gaze to both shared authentication stacks: `system-auth`, used by tools such as `sudo`, and `password-auth`, used by KDE's lock screen, SDDM, and Plasma Login Manager. RPM upgrades refresh these generated PAM files automatically when the Gaze profile is active.

::: tip KDE lock screen needs `gaze-kde` to be hands-free
Being in `password-auth` means Gaze runs when KDE's lock screen authenticates, but on its own that only happens once you submit the password field. For face unlock that starts by itself, install `gaze-kde`, which runs Gaze in the slot KScreenLocker starts up front for biometrics. It also stops Gaze running twice on one lock screen, since `/etc/pam.d/kde` includes `password-auth`. See the [KDE Plasma guide](/guide/kde).
:::

Enable it:

```bash
sudo authselect select gaze with-silent-lastlog --force
```

Or simultaneous mode:

```bash
sudo authselect select gaze with-face-simultaneous with-silent-lastlog --force
```

Add a retry after a rejected password to either of the above:

```bash
sudo authselect enable-feature with-face-retry
```

Verify profile + PAM behavior:

```bash
sudo authselect current
sudo -v
```

## openSUSE Tumbleweed

The openSUSE package ships a `pam-config` definition for Gaze and enables it
in its post-install script. This adds Gaze to the managed `common-auth` stack,
covering `sudo`, GDM, the GNOME lock screen, and other PAM services that include
`common-auth`. To apply it again after changing PAM modules, run:

```bash
sudo pam-config --add --gaze
sudo pam-config --update
```

The `--gaze` option is provided by the Gaze package's definition under
`/usr/lib/pam-config.d`. If `pam-config` reports an unknown option, confirm
that the base `gaze` package (not only `gaze-gui` or the GNOME extension) is
installed.

### sudo asks for the root password

openSUSE's vendor `/usr/etc/sudoers` sets `Defaults targetpw`, so `sudo`
authenticates the target user (root) rather than you. Root has no face
enrollment, so the camera never starts and sudo asks for the root password even
though `gaze auth` and `sudo -u "$USER" -v` work. `gaze doctor` reports this as
**Sudo policy**. openSUSE ships a drop-in that exempts members of `wheel`:

```bash
sudo zypper install sudo-policy-wheel-auth-self
```

After that, `sudo` authenticates you with your own password or face. Outside
`wheel`, drop `Defaults targetpw` with `visudo` or scope it with
`Defaults:%<group> !targetpw`.

### Simultaneous mode on openSUSE

There is no `pam-config` definition for simultaneous mode. The package ships
only `--gaze` (sequential) and `--gaze_retry`, so add the `simultaneous` option
by hand: run `sudo pam-config --add --gaze && sudo pam-config --update`, then
edit the generated `/etc/pam.d/common-auth-pc` so the Gaze line reads

```text
auth    sufficient    pam_gaze.so simultaneous
```

`pam-config --update` regenerates that file, so re-apply the edit after any
later `pam-config` run.

::: warning `pam_gaze_grosshack.so` is deprecated
Older openSUSE instructions used `sudo pam-config --add --gaze_grosshack`. That
definition is no longer shipped, and the module it enabled prints a deprecation
notice on every authentication and will be removed in a future release. If
`/etc/pam.d` still references it, drop it with
`sudo pam-config --delete --gaze_grosshack` and use `pam_gaze.so simultaneous`
instead. `gaze doctor` reports a stack that still loads it.
:::

To add a retry after a rejected password, enable the retry definition alongside
whichever of the above you use:

```bash
sudo pam-config --add --gaze_retry
sudo pam-config --update
```

::: warning
The openSUSE retry definition is newer than the others and has had less testing
on Tumbleweed than the Debian and Fedora profiles. Check the generated
`/etc/pam.d/common-auth` afterwards and confirm the `pam_gaze.so retry` line
landed *below* `pam_unix.so`. If it did not, remove it with
`sudo pam-config --delete --gaze_retry` and add the line by hand instead.
:::

Check that the managed file contains Gaze and that the common-auth link still
points at the generated file:

```bash
grep pam_gaze /etc/pam.d/common-auth-pc
readlink -f /etc/pam.d/common-auth
gaze doctor
```

Keep a root shell open while testing changes to the shared authentication
stack. If `common-auth` is not managed by `pam-config` on your installation,
follow [Other distros (manual)](#other-distros-manual) and add
`pam_gaze.so` to the service-specific PAM files instead.

## Arch Linux / Manjaro

The one-liner installer and the AUR package post-install script both configure `/etc/pam.d/sudo` automatically, inserting a faillock preauth gate and `pam_gaze.so` before the existing `auth include system-auth` line. The gate runs first so a locked-out account is rejected before face authentication can succeed; they do this only once: if you take the lines out again, upgrades leave them out. See [Opting out of the sudo change](#opting-out-of-the-sudo-change).

If you need to apply or re-apply it manually:

```bash
sudo awk '
    /^[[:space:]]*auth[[:space:]]/ && !done {
        print "-auth       requisite     pam_faillock.so preauth"
        print "auth        sufficient    pam_gaze.so"
        done = 1
    }
    { print }
' /etc/pam.d/sudo | sudo tee /tmp/pam-sudo-new && sudo install -m 644 /tmp/pam-sudo-new /etc/pam.d/sudo
```

A successful face authentication skips the rest of the stack, so the preauth
gate must come first: without it a locked-out account could still pass face
authentication. If the file's first `auth` line is already a faillock preauth,
add only the `pam_gaze.so` line below it.

Then test:

```bash
sudo -v
```

::: warning pambase updates
`/etc/pam.d/system-auth` is owned by the `pambase` package and gets overwritten on system upgrades. Gaze is added to `/etc/pam.d/sudo` directly to avoid this, but if you manually added `pam_gaze.so` to `system-auth` it will be lost on `pambase` updates.
:::

### Opting out of the sudo change

`/etc/pam.d/sudo` belongs to the `sudo` package, not to Gaze. Once Gaze inserts its line pacman sees the file as locally modified and writes `/etc/pam.d/sudo.pacnew` on later `sudo` updates instead of replacing it, so those updates have to be merged by hand.

To keep face authentication out of terminal elevation, delete the `pam_gaze.so` line and the faillock gate above it:

```bash
sudo sed -i '/pam_gaze/d; /^-auth       requisite     pam_faillock\.so preauth$/d' /etc/pam.d/sudo
```

Gaze will not add it back. The next install or upgrade notices the line it wrote is gone, records the choice in `/etc/gaze/pam-sudo.optout`, and leaves the file alone from then on. Once that marker exists `gaze doctor` reports the sudo slot as off instead of warning about it.

To skip the wait, or to keep Gaze away from `/etc/pam.d/sudo` from the very first install, write the marker yourself:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/gaze
sudo touch /etc/gaze/pam-sudo.optout
```

To undo the opt-out, remove the marker and re-apply the line by hand with the `awk` command above:

```bash
sudo rm /etc/gaze/pam-sudo.optout
```

Removing the Gaze package deletes the marker along with the rest of `/etc/gaze`.

### Polkit (graphical "Authentication Required" prompts)

Arch's `polkit` package ships no `/etc/pam.d/polkit-1`, so the `polkit-1` PAM service falls back to the vendor default at `/usr/lib/pam.d/polkit-1`, which just does `include system-auth`. Since Gaze avoids patching `system-auth` (see above), graphical polkit prompts (`pkexec`, GNOME Settings, package manager GUIs, etc.) don't get face auth unless a `/etc/pam.d/polkit-1` override is installed too. The Arch package and `dev-link-system.sh` create one automatically, and only on Arch:

```text
#%PAM-1.0
-auth       requisite     pam_faillock.so preauth
auth       sufficient   pam_gaze.so
auth       include      system-auth
account    include      system-auth
password   include      system-auth
session    include      system-auth
```

Verify with:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart polkit
pkexec true
```

Some Arch derivatives (Omarchy, for one) do ship an `/etc/pam.d/polkit-1` of their own. There the package adds only the `pam_gaze.so` line, above the first `auth` line, and keeps the rest of the file as it is; the original is copied to `/etc/gaze/polkit-1.pam.bak` first (`dev-link-system.sh` does the same, to `polkit-1.pam.dev.bak`). Removing Gaze strips that line back out and leaves the file in place, rather than deleting a file Gaze did not create.

Debian/Ubuntu and Fedora ship their own `polkit-1` PAM service and do not use `system-auth` the way Arch does, so Gaze never writes this file there. On those systems polkit picks up face auth through the shared auth stack (`pam-auth-update` on Debian/Ubuntu, the `gaze` authselect feature on Fedora). Recent Debian and Ubuntu releases ship that file as a vendor default in `/usr/lib/pam.d/polkit-1` instead of `/etc/pam.d/polkit-1`, but it still includes `common-auth`, so the shared-stack route works either way. An explicit `/etc/pam.d/polkit-1` override is only needed there if you deliberately took Gaze out of the shared stack, as in [Selective setup](#selective-setup-password-at-gdm-face-authentication-for-sudo-and-polkit).

## Other distros (manual)

Edit your shared auth stack (for example `/etc/pam.d/system-auth` on Fedora or
Arch, or `/etc/pam.d/common-auth-pc` on openSUSE when `pam-config` is not
available) and place Gaze before `pam_unix.so`.

Sequential:

```text
auth    sufficient    pam_gaze.so
auth    sufficient    pam_unix.so try_first_pass nullok
```

Simultaneous:

```text
auth    sufficient    pam_gaze.so simultaneous
auth    sufficient    pam_unix.so try_first_pass nullok
```

Then test with `sudo -v`.

## Retry after a rejected password

By default a typed password ends the Gaze attempt. In simultaneous mode Gaze
stands down as soon as you submit one, and if that password turns out to be
wrong the whole authentication fails: there is no second look at the camera.

The `retry` option adds one. It is a *second* `pam_gaze.so` line placed below
the password module, so it is only reached when the password was rejected:

```text
auth    sufficient    pam_gaze.so simultaneous
auth    sufficient    pam_unix.so try_first_pass nullok
auth    sufficient    pam_gaze.so retry
```

The first line still gives you face-or-password. The third line is what catches
a typo: the password is rejected, and Gaze looks once more instead of failing
the attempt outright.

Retry composes with either mode, so `pam_gaze.so` on its own works as the first
line too.

### It does not repeat a decided verdict

A retry entry is not a second full camera run in every case. When the first
Gaze entry already saw a face and decided it was not yours, the retry entry
stands down immediately rather than spending another camera timeout on a
question that has been answered. It only looks again when the first pass was
undecided: no face found, too dark, timed out, camera unavailable, or a
password submitted before the camera reached a verdict.

### Enabling it

On Debian and Ubuntu the profile is shipped but off by default:

```bash
sudo pam-auth-update --enable gaze-retry
```

On Fedora it is an authselect feature:

```bash
sudo authselect enable-feature with-face-retry
```

### Lockout counters

A rejected password is still a rejected password. On distributions that use
`pam_faillock`, the failed attempt may be tallied even when the face retry then
succeeds. The shipped Fedora profile places the retry entry *above*
`pam_faillock.so authfail` so a successful retry short-circuits before the tally
is written, but stacks you assemble by hand will not do this unless you order
them the same way.

If you type passwords wrong often and rely on the retry, check `faillock --user
$USER` after a few attempts to confirm your stack behaves the way you expect.

## Browser extensions through Polkit (Bitwarden)

A browser extension cannot call PAM directly. Bitwarden's browser extension
hands an unlock request to the running Bitwarden desktop app through native
messaging. On Linux, the desktop app asks Polkit to authorize the
`com.bitwarden.Bitwarden.unlock` action, and the graphical Polkit agent runs the
normal `polkit-1` PAM service. Gaze therefore needs no Firefox-, Chromium-, or
Zen-specific hook: if Gaze is in the `polkit-1` stack, the request follows the
same path as any other graphical authentication prompt.

Set up and test the layers in order:

1. Follow the Polkit setup for your distribution above, then check that a plain
   Polkit request starts Gaze:

   ```bash
   gaze doctor
   pkexec /usr/bin/true
   ```

2. In the Bitwarden desktop app, enable **Unlock with system authentication**
   and **Allow browser integration**. Keep the desktop app running, logged in,
   and unlocked while setting up the extension.
3. In the browser extension, open **Settings → Account security**, enable
   **Unlock with biometrics**, and approve the connection in the desktop app.
   See [Bitwarden's biometric unlock guide](https://bitwarden.com/help/biometrics/)
   for browser and package-specific requirements.

If desktop unlock already uses Gaze but the browser extension never opens a
Polkit dialog, the request has not reached PAM. Check the native-messaging setup,
whether the desktop app is running and logged in, and whether Bitwarden supports
that browser and installation method. Adding another Gaze PAM entry cannot fix a
native-messaging failure.

If a Polkit prompt appears but Gaze does not run, return to the distribution's
Polkit setup above. `pkexec /usr/bin/true` must use Gaze first. To confirm that a
Bitwarden attempt reached the daemon through the expected service, check:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u gazed -b --no-pager | grep 'service="polkit-1"'
```

Do not add a Polkit rule that automatically authorizes Bitwarden or a browser.
That would bypass authentication rather than route it to Gaze. Bitwarden owns
the desktop/native-messaging trust boundary; Gaze only supplies face
authentication when Polkit invokes PAM.

## Safety notes

- Keep password auth enabled while testing.
- Keep a root shell open before changing PAM.
- Back up PAM files first so you can restore quickly.

# GUI Guide

::: tip On KDE Plasma
`gaze-kde` adds a **Face Unlock** entry to System Settings that opens this app. See the
[KDE Plasma guide](/guide/kde#system-settings).
:::

Use `gaze-gui` to enroll your face, test recognition, and adjust Gaze settings.

Launch it:

```bash
gaze-gui
```

- **Enroll a face:** Follow the camera prompts. If both RGB and IR cameras are configured, Gaze captures from both.
- **View profiles:** The main window lists enrolled faces, their total template counts, and `RGB` and `IR` badges. A badge is green when the profile has captures for that spectrum, amber when a camera is configured but the profile has no captures, and grey when no camera is configured. An RGB-only machine therefore shows a green `RGB` badge and a grey `IR` badge; grey does not indicate a failure.
- **Refine a profile:** Select its edit/refine icon to capture additional samples or add a missing spectrum. For example, you can add IR captures to an RGB-only profile after configuring an IR camera.
- **Test authentication:** Run a face scan to check whether Gaze recognizes you.
- **Remove profiles:** Delete individual face profiles.
- **Change daemon settings:** Adjust the security level, cameras, liveness settings, and hybrid policy.

## Configuration dialog

Open the config dialog from the header-bar settings button.

The dialog mirrors `/etc/gaze/config.toml`, grouped the same way. Saving writes
the file through the daemon, so it needs a polkit authorization.

**Security**

- Security level (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `maximum`, or `custom`)
- For `custom`: detector level, recognizer level, RGB and IR similarity thresholds

**Hardware**

- Inference execution provider: CPU, automatic NPU selection, Intel OpenVINO, or AMD Vitis AI
- OpenVINO inference device; automatic and AMD modes select NPU

The standard build exposes all providers. Install the vendor runtime and drivers
using [Hardware Acceleration](/guide/acceleration), then restart the daemon after changing its provider.

**Cameras**

- RGB camera source, IR camera source, and Force IR Emitter
- Parallel RGB + IR Capture, which decides whether hybrid verification reads both
  sensors at once. Some webcams cannot, so the default captures them one at a time
- Darkness cutoff, the dark-frame rejection threshold

**Enrollment**

- Max templates per face
- Minimum face size ratio, where lower values allow enrollment from farther away

**Liveness Anti-Spoofing**

- Enable liveness spoof prevention, liveness threshold, liveness max seconds

**Auth**

- Abort if SSH, abort if lid closed
- Require a suspend first, which refuses face auth until the machine has suspended
  and resumed once
- Require confirmation on lock screen, require confirmation for elevated auth
- Resume grace period and start delay, both in milliseconds
- Start delay applies to, either every face auth or screen lockers only
- Hybrid combining policy, used when both RGB and IR are enrolled

**Storage**

- Encrypt face templates, which seals enrolled templates with the TPM. See
  [How it works](/guide/how-it-works) for what that protects against.
- Unlock GNOME Keyring, which replays an enrolled password after a
  liveness-protected GDM or greetd face login. It needs template encryption and
  liveness on, and each user still has to run `gaze keyring`. Read
  [what it changes about your security](/guide/gnome#what-this-changes-about-your-security)
  first.

## Common tasks

1. Enroll a profile named `default`.
2. Run test authentication several times in normal room light.
3. Add another profile if your appearance varies often (for example, glasses).

## When to use GUI vs CLI

- Use GUI for enrollment and quick pass/fail checks.
- Use CLI (`gaze auth --verbose`) when you want detailed authentication metrics and diagnostics.

## If the GUI cannot authenticate

Check daemon status:

```bash
systemctl status gazed
```

If the service is stopped, enable and start it:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now gazed
```

Then retry from GUI.

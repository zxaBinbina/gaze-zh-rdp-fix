# Hyprland (hyprlock)

For Omarchy releases using the Quickshell lock screen, use the
[Omarchy integration](/guide/omarchy). The PAM configuration below applies to hyprlock.

Gaze integrates with [hyprlock](https://github.com/hyprwm/hyprlock), the Hyprland screen locker, via a dedicated PAM service. The `gaze-hyprlock` package installs `/etc/pam.d/hyprlock-gaze`, leaving the distro's own `/etc/pam.d/hyprlock` untouched.

You opt in by pointing `hyprlock.conf` at the Gaze PAM service.

## Install

The one-line installer auto-installs `gaze-hyprlock` and edits `~/.config/hypr/hyprlock.conf` when it detects a Hyprland session or the `hyprlock` binary.

Manual install:

::: code-group

```bash [Debian/Ubuntu]
sudo apt-get install gaze-hyprlock
```

```bash [Fedora and compatible]
sudo dnf install gaze-hyprlock
```

```bash [openSUSE Tumbleweed]
sudo zypper install gaze-hyprlock
```

```bash [Arch]
yay -S gaze-hyprlock-bin
```

:::

## Enable

Add to `~/.config/hypr/hyprlock.conf`:

```ini
auth {
    pam {
        module = hyprlock-gaze
    }
}
```

Restart hyprlock or lock the session again. Face unlock runs first; if it fails or times out, hyprlock falls back to the password prompt.

## Simultaneous mode

For password-and-face authentication in parallel (type your password while the camera matches your face; whichever succeeds first unlocks), use:

```ini
auth {
    pam {
        module = hyprlock-gaze-simultaneous
    }
}
```

This uses `pam_gaze.so simultaneous`, running Gaze alongside the password prompt instead of blocking it.

## How it works

`hyprlock-gaze` is a PAM service that stacks `pam_gaze.so` on top of your
system password stack (`system-auth` on Fedora/RHEL and Arch, `common-auth` on
Debian/Ubuntu and openSUSE), with `pam_nologin` and `pam_faillock preauth`
running before Gaze. Those gates must come first because a `success=done`
face match ends the whole auth stack and would otherwise skip the lockout and
nologin checks the include pulls in (the same reason `gaze-kde-pam` carries
them inside its own block). The auth flow:

1. hyprlock calls PAM with service name `hyprlock-gaze`
2. `pam_gaze.so` runs as the logged-in user, claims the camera via the `gazed` DBus service, and runs face verification
3. On match → `PAM_SUCCESS`, hyprlock unlocks
4. On no enrolled faces or daemon unavailable → `PAM_IGNORE`, hyprlock proceeds to password
5. On no match → `PAM_AUTH_ERR`, hyprlock proceeds to password

No `gazed` configuration changes are required. The DBus policy already permits unprivileged users to claim the camera and run verification against their own enrolled templates.

## Prerequisites

- `gazed` daemon running (`systemctl status gazed`)
- At least one enrolled face: `gaze add-face default`
- Working camera (test with `gaze auth`)

## Disable

Remove the `module` line from the `auth { pam { ... } }` block in `hyprlock.conf` (or set it to hyprlock's default, `hyprlock`). Uninstall the package if you do not plan to use it again:

::: code-group

```bash [Debian/Ubuntu]
sudo apt-get remove gaze-hyprlock
```

```bash [Fedora and compatible]
sudo dnf remove gaze-hyprlock
```

```bash [openSUSE Tumbleweed]
sudo zypper remove gaze-hyprlock
```

```bash [Arch]
yay -R gaze-hyprlock-bin
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Falls back to password every time**: daemon may not be running, or no faces enrolled for the current user. Check `systemctl status gazed` and `gaze list-faces`.
- **Unlocks itself right after you lock manually**: hyprlock starts its PAM stack as soon as it launches, so face authentication runs while you are still in front of the camera. Set [`auth.start_delay_ms`](/guide/configuration) to give yourself time to step away, and `auth.start_delay_scope = "screen_lock"` so the delay does not also slow down `sudo` and polkit prompts. Note that hyprlock's own `general:grace` / `--grace` option will not help here; it unlocks on any keypress or cursor movement within the window rather than delaying authentication.
- **Camera busy**: another Gaze client (GUI, GNOME extension) may hold the camera. Close it and retry.
- **PAM error in logs**: check `journalctl -u gazed` and `journalctl --user -t hyprlock`.

# Installation

Choose the installation method that suits your system. When you use the one-line installer, it detects your desktop and configures the matching integration where possible: GNOME lock screen authentication, the Cinnamon extension, KDE packages, or the Omarchy lock integration. On other desktops, it skips desktop-specific packages. Manual GNOME and Cinnamon installs require an extra step to enable the extension.

On x86_64 and arm64, the installer supports Ubuntu 24.04/25.10/26.04/26.10,
Debian 13 and 14 (forky, currently testing), Fedora 42/43/44/45 and compatible
distributions (including image-based OSTree systems such as Silverblue, Kinoite,
and Bazzite), Arch Linux, and Arch-compatible AUR distributions such as Manjaro
and CachyOS. openSUSE Tumbleweed is supported on x86_64.

## CPU requirement

On x86_64, the `gazed` daemon requires **AVX2** (Intel Haswell and newer, roughly 2013 onward; AMD Excavator and newer, roughly 2015 onward). The ONNX Runtime it links issues AVX2 instructions during startup, so on an older CPU the daemon exits immediately rather than running degraded.

Check before installing:

```bash
grep -qw avx2 /proc/cpuinfo && echo "AVX2 present" || echo "AVX2 missing"
```

Gaze's inference runtime needs AVX2 on x86_64. If your CPU does not support it,
the one-line installer stops before making system changes; package installs leave
`gazed` stopped, though the CLI and PAM modules are still installed. `gaze doctor`
reports the limitation as well. Face authentication requires a CPU with AVX2;
see [troubleshooting](./troubleshooting) for details.

## Path A: one-line installer (recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://gaze.gundulabs.com/install.sh | sh
```

The installer adds:

- the Gaze daemon and CLI
- `gaze-gui`
- the GNOME Shell extension package only when a GNOME desktop session is detected
- the Cinnamon extension package only when a Cinnamon desktop session is detected

The installer also configures package updates where needed and enables the `gazed` daemon. When supported, it enables lock screen face unlock or PolKit confirmation for your current user.

Desktop integration depends on the session it detects. On KDE Plasma, it installs `gaze-kde` to wire up the lock screen; on Cinnamon, it installs `gaze-cinnamon-extension`. For Quickshell Omarchy, it selects `gaze-omarchy`; see the [Omarchy guide](/guide/omarchy) for setup instructions and supported versions. Other desktops do not receive desktop extension packages.

On OSTree systems such as Silverblue, Bazzite, and Kinoite, the installer uses `rpm-ostree` to layer the packages. On openSUSE Tumbleweed, it uses `zypper` and Gaze's Tumbleweed-specific RPM repository.

Desktop behavior:

- CLI, GUI, and normal PAM prompts work without desktop extensions.
- If the installer detects Cinnamon, it installs `gaze-cinnamon-extension` and enables it for the session.
- If the installer detects KDE Plasma, it installs `gaze-kde` alongside the base packages, so the lock screen starts face auth on its own and a Face Unlock entry appears in System Settings.
- On Quickshell Omarchy, it installs the Gaze lock plugin and enables it from the unlocked desktop user session.
- If you later want GNOME or Cinnamon lock screen support, install the appropriate extension package manually from your desktop session.
- GDM loads the extension from package defaults when the extension package is installed, but GDM login face auth stays disabled unless you explicitly enable it.

For non-interactive installs:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://gaze.gundulabs.com/install.sh | sh -s -- --yes
```

## Path B: manual package install

Use this if you prefer to configure package sources yourself. Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora-compatible systems, and openSUSE Tumbleweed use Gundu Labs repositories. Arch Linux and Arch-compatible distributions such as Manjaro and CachyOS use the AUR packages.

Debian/Ubuntu packages are built per release, and each apt suite carries only the builds for that release: `noble` (Ubuntu 24.04), `questing` (Ubuntu 25.10), `resolute` (Ubuntu 26.04), `stonking` (Ubuntu 26.10), `trixie` (Debian 13), and `forky` (Debian 14). The snippet below picks the suite matching your system; installing another release's package leaves `gazed` unable to load its OpenCV libraries.

Debian 14 (forky) is still testing, so its libraries keep moving. The `forky` packages are built against whatever OpenCV and GTK sonames testing carried at release time, and a soname bump in testing can leave `gazed` unable to start until the next Gaze release rebuilds against it. Reinstalling from the `forky` suite after such a bump picks up the rebuilt package.

If you are replacing an existing manual repository configuration, remove the current repo files first:

**Debian / Ubuntu:**
```bash
sudo rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gundulabs.list /usr/share/keyrings/gundulabs-archive-keyring.gpg
```

**Fedora and compatible DNF/rpm-ostree systems:**
```bash
sudo rm -f /etc/yum.repos.d/gundulabs.repo /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-gundulabs
```

**openSUSE Tumbleweed:**

```bash
sudo rm -f /etc/zypp/repos.d/gundulabs.repo /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-gundulabs
```

:::

The openSUSE RPM ships a `pam-config` definition and enables Gaze for `sudo`,
GDM, and other services that include `common-auth` in its post-install script.
To reapply the setting manually after changing PAM modules, run:

```bash
sudo pam-config --add --gaze
sudo pam-config --update
```

The one-line installer also reapplies this setting after the package install
when `pam-config` is available.

::: warning Arch: install the `-bin` packages, not the release artifacts
On Arch, install Gaze only through the AUR packages above. The
`gaze-*.pkg.tar.zst` files attached to each GitHub release are the inputs the
AUR wrappers unpack, not a supported install path: they carry the plain package
names `gaze` and `gaze-gui`, and an unrelated AUR package is also named `gaze`
(a file watcher). Installing them with `pacman -U` leaves a foreign `gaze` that
the next `yay -Syu` or `paru -Syu` silently "upgrades" to the unrelated package,
removing `gazed`, the PAM modules, and the systemd unit. See
[Gaze disappears after an AUR helper upgrade](/guide/troubleshooting#gaze-disappears-after-an-aur-helper-upgrade-arch-linux)
if this already happened to you.
:::

## Path C: GUI-only via Flatpak

The Flatpak is published to the Gundu Labs repository. The signing key and repo
URL are embedded in the `.flatpakref`, so one command adds the remote and installs
the app:

```bash
flatpak install --from https://packages.gundulabs.com/flatpak/com.gundulabs.Gaze.flatpakref
```

This installs the sandboxed Gaze GUI only. It talks to the `gazed` daemon on the system bus, so you still need to install one of the system packages (Path A or B) for the daemon and PAM integration. Use this path when you want the GUI updated independently of the system package.

### Enable GNOME lock screen auth after manual install

Only run this on GNOME desktops where you want face unlock from the lock screen. First install the extension package for your distro, then enable it for your user; package managers do not safely change per-user extension settings.

::: code-group

```bash [Debian/Ubuntu]
sudo apt install gaze-gnome-extension
```

```bash [Fedora and compatible]
sudo dnf install gaze-gnome-extension
```

```bash [openSUSE Tumbleweed]
sudo zypper install gaze-gnome-extension
```

```bash [Arch Linux / Manjaro / CachyOS]
yay -S --needed gaze-gnome-extension-bin
```

:::

```bash
gnome-extensions enable gaze@gundulabs.com
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.gaze enable-face-authentication true
```

Reboot once after installing or updating the extension if the lock screen does not pick it up immediately. Run the two commands above from a session that started **after** the package was installed: GNOME Shell drops extension IDs it has not scanned yet, so enabling one from the session you installed in can look right and then be gone after the next logout. See [The extension disappears again after a logout](/guide/gnome#the-extension-disappears-again-after-a-logout).

GDM login face auth stays disabled unless you explicitly enable it; see the [GNOME Extension guide](/guide/gnome) before doing that.

### KDE Plasma and other PAM-based desktops

The one-line installer detects KDE Plasma and intentionally skips `gaze-gnome-extension`, because that package depends on GNOME Shell. It installs `gaze-kde` instead, which makes the KDE **lock screen** start face auth on its own with no key press and adds a Face Unlock entry to System Settings. Keep password fallback enabled while testing.

The KDE **login greeter** (Plasma Login Manager, or SDDM) is a separate program with no up-front biometric slot upstream, so face auth there starts when you submit the login form, exactly as a fingerprint reader does on the same screen. See the [KDE Plasma guide](/guide/kde#login-greeter).

For other PAM-based desktops, use the base `gaze` package's PAM modules and see the [PAM guide](/guide/pam).

### Omarchy Quickshell lock

Use the [Omarchy guide](/guide/omarchy). The `gaze-omarchy` package provides independent face, password and fingerprint PAM conversations. After installation, run `gaze-omarchy enable` without sudo from your unlocked desktop. It supports Omarchy 4.0.2/4.0.3 and checks the shell files before enablement.

### Enable face unlock for hyprlock

On Hyprland using hyprlock, install the `gaze-hyprlock` package (auto-installed by the one-line installer when Hyprland is detected) and point hyprlock at the Gaze PAM service. See the [Hyprland guide](/guide/hyprland).

## Path D: Nix and NixOS

Gaze ships a Nix flake with packages and a NixOS module that sets up the
daemon, D-Bus/polkit policies, and PAM declaratively:

```nix
# flake.nix inputs
inputs.gaze.url = "github:GunduLabs/gaze";
```

```nix
# NixOS configuration
imports = [ inputs.gaze.nixosModules.default ];
services.gaze = {
  enable = true;
  gui.enable = true;
};
```

On non-NixOS systems with Nix or home-manager you can install the CLI and GUI
from the flake, but the daemon and PAM integration still need a system package
(Path A or B). See the [Nix & NixOS guide](/guide/nixos) for module options,
GNOME/hyprlock integration, and home-manager usage.

## Restart after install

After installing Gaze by any method, reboot once to apply all system-level changes.

```bash
sudo reboot
```

## Verify installation

```bash
systemctl status gazed
gaze --version
gaze doctor
gaze-gui --help
```

Run `gaze doctor` as your desktop user. This lets it inspect your PipeWire session and desktop integration.

If the daemon is inactive, start and enable it with:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now gazed
```

## First run

```bash
gaze add-face default
gaze auth --verbose
```

## Development and source builds

See the [Development guide](/guide/development) for source builds, tests, packaging, and Flatpak development workflows.

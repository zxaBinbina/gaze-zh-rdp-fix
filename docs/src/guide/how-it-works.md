# How Gaze Works

This page explains how Gaze's facial authentication pipeline works. You do not need it to use Gaze, but it can help make sense of its behavior.

## Security & Liveness

Gaze performs liveness checks locally and supports infrared (IR) cameras to help resist spoofing.

Using an IR camera alongside RGB liveness checks helps Gaze resist presentation
attacks such as printed photos, screen replays, and videos. In high-security
environments, keep your usual system authentication, such as a password,
enabled as a fallback.

## Privacy model

- Gaze processes faces locally on your machine; it does not send face data to a cloud service.
- No cloud account is required.
- Face embeddings are stored on disk in Gaze's local data directory, which is readable only by root.
- You can optionally encrypt them at rest with a key sealed to the TPM. A stolen disk then cannot be used to recover the embeddings on another machine. See [template encryption](/guide/configuration#encrypt-face-templates-with-the-tpm).
- If you enable [GNOME Keyring unlock](/guide/gnome#optional-tpm-backed-keyring-unlock), your account password is additionally stored in a TPM-protected record so a face login can unlock the keyring. That record is recoverable by root on this machine; read the security notes before turning it on.

## Authentication pipeline

```text
Camera frame -> Face detection (SCRFD) -> Face alignment -> Embedding (ArcFace: MobileFaceNet by default, ResNet50 at high/maximum security) -> Similarity match -> Liveness check (MiniFASNet-V2 / eye-motion on IR)
```

At a high level, authentication works as follows:

1. Gaze captures a frame from your configured GStreamer camera source.
2. The detector locates a face and its landmarks.
3. Gaze aligns the face to a standard input shape.
4. The recognition model converts the face into an embedding vector.
5. Gaze compares the embedding with your enrolled profiles. If both RGB and IR cameras are active, it combines their results according to the configured hybrid policy. Depending on that policy, either or both cameras must match, or Gaze can fall back to IR when the scene is dark.
6. If liveness checks are enabled, MiniFASNet-V2 checks the face crop for spoofing. On the IR camera path, Gaze instead checks for eye movement across frames.

Authentication succeeds when the best similarity and liveness scores both meet their configured thresholds.

## One authentication attempt

Everything below happens once per `gaze auth`, PAM prompt, or lock screen unlock. The
same daemon code runs on every surface, so a problem you can reproduce with
`gaze auth --verbose` is the same problem the lock screen hits.

### Before the camera opens

1. The client claims the daemon over DBus. A claim binds the run to one user,
   and the client releases it when it finishes. A claim that is never released is
    reclaimed after 5 minutes so an abandoned claim cannot keep the camera busy.
2. Gaze checks three refusals in order: no suspend or resume since boot
   (`auth.abort_before_first_resume`), the caller sits inside an SSH session
   (`auth.abort_if_ssh`), and the laptop lid is closed (`auth.abort_if_lid_closed`). Any of
   them ends the attempt before a camera is touched.
3. Gaze works out which spectra can run. RGB runs when `cameras.rgb` is set *and* you have
   RGB templates enrolled; IR runs on the same rule. If neither can run, or if
   `security.hybrid_policy = "and"` demands both but you enrolled only one, the attempt ends
    here rather than proceeding with incomplete evidence.
4. `auth.start_delay_ms` and `auth.resume_grace_ms` hold the capture back. Time the screen has
   already been locked counts against the delay, so a screen locked longer than
   `start_delay_ms` starts immediately. The lid is checked once more after the delay, since it
   can close while Gaze waits.

### Opening the camera

5. The configured source resolves to a kernel `/dev/videoN` node, which is captured
   directly with `v4l2src`. `primary` means the first color node, a PipeWire target
   resolves to the node behind that same camera, and a `/dev/videoN` path or USB
   `vid:pid` names its node outright. The user-session PipeWire socket is never
   connected to: it is controlled by the user being authenticated. A source with
   no kernel node, including a hand-written GStreamer pipeline, is refused.
6. The pipeline gets 500 ms to reach the playing state. A slower camera is not treated as a
   failure: the frame loop reports any error that arrives later.
7. Unprivileged previews (for example the GUI camera view) may still open a
   `pipewiresrc` pipeline in the user's own session, where trusting that session
   is correct. Authentication and enrollment never do.

### Reading frames

8. **Warm-up.** Sensors that run their own auto-exposure stream black frames for a moment after
   the pipeline starts, so an early dark frame says nothing about the room. For up to 2 seconds
   those frames are ignored instead of reported. The grace is conditional: if the stream has not
   brightened at all after 1 second and at least 8 frames, Gaze concludes nothing is warming up
   and reports the darkness immediately. The grace is also spent the moment the stream is ever
   lit, so a lens covered mid-scan is reported at once. The warm-up is skipped entirely when a
   dark RGB frame would hand the camera straight to IR, so hybrid setups keep their immediate
   hand-off.
9. **Dark gate.** A frame whose mean luma is below `cameras.dark_luma_threshold` (default 20)
   is `TooDark` and never reaches the detector.
10. **Detection and matching.** The detector finds a face and landmarks, the face is aligned,
    the recognition model produces an embedding, and the embedding is compared against your
    enrolled templates. An embedding is only computed for a `Usable` frame, so a frame that is
    dark or badly framed costs a detection and nothing more.
11. **Liveness.** On a match, the anti-spoof model scores the face crop, and an eye-motion check
    runs across frames. Both must pass. A face that matches but fails liveness reports
    `Face matched, but the liveness check did not pass`.
12. **IR.** By default (`cameras.parallel_capture = "never"`) the IR phase waits for RGB to
    release the camera, then engages the emitter if one is configured. Windows Hello emitters
    strobe, so the IR path tolerates a run of dark frames and only reports darkness after 8
    consecutive ones.

### Deciding

The result is a verdict plus the last capture status from each spectrum. When both spectra
ran, `security.hybrid_policy` decides how they combine. The verdict travels back to the client
over DBus, and PAM turns it into a message and a return code.

## Timeouts and budgets

A watchdog checks the deadlines every 250 ms, so a camera that stops delivering frames
entirely is still bounded.

| Deadline | Value | Measured from | What happens |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Start delay | `auth.start_delay_ms`, at least `auth.resume_grace_ms` after a resume (both default 0) | the request | Capture is held back. Cancellable. |
| Pipeline start | 500 ms | `Playing` requested | Gaze stops waiting for the state change, but keeps the pipeline. |
| Camera warm-up | up to 2 s, cut short after 1 s and 8 frames if the stream never brightens | the first frame | Dark frames are ignored rather than reported. |
| Dark stream | 1 s | the first `TooDark` after warm-up | Attempt ends. "Need more light". |
| No face | 5 s | the last frame with a face in it | Attempt ends. "Face not detected". |
| No usable frame | 8 s | the last frame that produced an embedding | Attempt ends. Bounds a face that stays badly framed. |
| Serial RGB budget | 4 s | the RGB phase start | RGB hands the camera to IR even without a match. Only when IR also runs and `parallel_capture = "never"`. |
| Frame budget | `liveness.max_seconds` x camera fps, minimum 6 frames (default 2.0 s, so 60 frames at 30 fps) | frames counted only while a usable face is in view, per spectrum | Attempt ends. Logged as `frame budget spent`. |
| PAM backstop | 12 s plus the start delay | the PAM prompt | PAM stops waiting. "Face authentication timed out". |
| Client backstop | 20 s | the DBus call | The CLI or GUI stops waiting on the daemon. |
| Claim | 5 min | the claim | An unreleased claim is reclaimed. |

The deadlines nest deliberately: every daemon deadline fires before the PAM backstop, and the
PAM backstop fires before the client one, so you always get the specific reason rather than a
generic timeout.

## What the camera reports while it runs

Each frame produces one status. The GUI and the CLI show its text, and the daemon emits it over
DBus as `FaceStatus`.

| Status | Shown as | Means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Unused` | Camera is not in use... | That spectrum did not run. |
| `NoFace` | Please look at the camera... | The detector found nothing. |
| `TooDark` | Need more light... | The frame, or the face region in it, is below `cameras.dark_luma_threshold`. |
| `Clipped` | Face is clipped. Please move back... | The face touches the edge of the frame. |
| `Ready` | Hold still... | A face was found and this frame is dark, but the rolling average over the last 5 frames is not. A transient dip, not a verdict. |
| `Usable` | Hold still... | A face was found and is bright enough to match. Only these frames produce an embedding. |

`NotCentered`, `TooFar`, and `TooClose` exist too, but only enrollment checks centering and
proximity. During authentication you will never see them.

`Ready` and `Clipped` count as "a face is in view", so they hold off the no-face deadline but
not the no-usable one. That is why a face that is present but never quite usable ends at 8
seconds rather than running forever.

## How an attempt ends

| Ending | CLI | PAM message | PAM code |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Match | `Authenticated as: <face>` | Face Verified. | success |
| A face was judged and did not match | `Authentication failed` | Face not recognized. Enter your password. | `PAM_AUTH_ERR` |
| Matched, but liveness did not pass | `Authentication failed` plus the liveness note | Face not recognized. Enter your password. | `PAM_AUTH_ERR` |
| Ended too dark | `Authentication failed` | Too dark for face authentication. Enter your password. | `PAM_AUTHINFO_UNAVAIL` |
| Ended with no face | `Authentication failed` | Face not detected. Enter your password. | `PAM_AUTHINFO_UNAVAIL` |
| The camera never ran, or the daemon could not be reached | `Authentication failed` | Face authentication unavailable. Enter your password. | `PAM_AUTHINFO_UNAVAIL` |
| PAM budget spent | n/a, PAM only | Face authentication timed out. Enter your password. | `PAM_AUTHINFO_UNAVAIL` |

Only a face that was actually judged returns `PAM_AUTH_ERR`. Every other ending returns
`PAM_AUTHINFO_UNAVAIL`, which tells PAM that Gaze reached no decision rather than that you
failed an attempt, so a dark room or a camera in use by another program does not count against
you. A run that ends on a hardware error is reported the same way.

## Reading it in the logs

`journalctl -u gazed -b` records the shape of every attempt. The lines that map to the
deadlines above:

| Log line | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `VerifyStart: sensing faces for user ...` | Capture is starting. Names the spectra, the liveness settings, and whether capture is serial. |
| `Attempting to open GStreamer camera: ...` | The exact pipeline. Useful for confirming which source was actually used. |
| `Opening the PipeWire camera failed ...; trying a direct V4L2 device` | A PipeWire source (unprivileged preview path) did not open, and the V4L2 retry is next. Privileged authentication captures V4L2 directly and never logs this. |
| `RGB stream never brightened: mean_luma=0` | The stream is flat dark. A closed privacy shutter, a lens cap, or a genuinely dark room. |
| `RGB face region: mean_luma=..., threshold=..., status=...` | The luma reading behind a status. The first frame of each distinct status is logged. |
| `VerifyStart: giving up after 1000ms of dark frames` | The dark deadline. |
| `VerifyStart: giving up after 5s without a detected face` | The no-face deadline. |
| `VerifyStart: giving up after 8s without a usable frame` | The no-usable deadline. |
| `VerifyStart: frame budget spent` | The frame budget. `matched=true` on the same line means the face matched but liveness did not pass. |

## Why multiple captures help

Each enrollment stores multiple samples across slightly different angles.

That makes authentication more robust for:

- Small head rotation
- Minor lighting changes
- Appearance shifts (for example, glasses)

## Where data is stored

By default, Gaze stores its data in these locations:

- User embeddings: `/var/lib/gaze/users`
- TPM-sealed encryption key (only when template encryption is enabled): `/var/lib/gaze/tpm`
- TPM-protected GNOME Keyring credentials (only when `gaze keyring` has been run): `/var/lib/gaze/keyring`
- Model files: `/var/cache/gaze`
- Config file: `/etc/gaze/config.toml`

## Components

- `gazed`: daemon that performs detection and recognition (crate: `gaze`)
- `gaze`: CLI client (crate: `gaze-cli`, kept separate so the client binary does not link ONNX Runtime)
- `gaze-gui`: GTK app
- `pam_gaze.so`: PAM module. It holds no camera or inference code of its own; it asks `gazed` over DBus and reports the answer back to PAM. It links `gaze-security` so it can unseal a stored GNOME Keyring credential after a successful login
- PAM integration, the GNOME and Cinnamon extensions, and KDE's biometric PAM slot for login/lock screen flow

The CLI and GUI communicate with the daemon over DBus (`com.gundulabs.Gaze`).

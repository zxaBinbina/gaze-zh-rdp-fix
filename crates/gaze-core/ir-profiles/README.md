# IR emitter device profiles

Each `*.toml` file maps a USB UVC camera VID:PID to the raw UVC extension-unit control sequence needed to enable and disable its IR emitter.

These profiles cover USB UVC controls only. Non-USB emitters controlled over
I2C use the separately validated profiles in [`i2c-ir-profiles/`](../i2c-ir-profiles/README.md)
and the I2C transport backend.

File names are lowercase hex without `0x`: `vvvv-pppp.toml`.

## Simple single-control format

```toml
[device]
vendor_id  = 0x04F2
product_id = 0xB6D9
name       = "Example IR camera"
source     = "URL or issue where the bytes were confirmed"

[emitter]
unit              = 14
selector          = 6
control_bytes     = [1, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
off_control_bytes = [1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

If `off_control_bytes` is omitted, zeros of the same length are used.

## Multi-step sequence format

Use this for devices that require multiple UVC requests or `GET_CUR` priming steps:

```toml
[device]
vendor_id  = 0x0BDA
product_id = 0x5767
name       = "Realtek/Dell 0JCXG0 Integrated_Webcam_HD"
source     = "https://github.com/SeeleVolleri/research_0jcxg0"

[[emitter.on]]
unit = 4
selector = 10
query = "set_cur"
control_bytes = [0xff, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[[emitter.on]]
unit = 4
selector = 11
query = "get_cur"
size = 8

[[emitter.off]]
unit = 4
selector = 10
query = "set_cur"
control_bytes = [0xff, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[[emitter.off]]
unit = 4
selector = 11
query = "set_cur"
control_bytes = [0x01, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

A profile that defines `[[emitter.on]]` must also define `[[emitter.off]]`. The
build script fails with `uses emitter.on but has no emitter.off` otherwise,
which breaks the whole workspace build. Only the simple single-control format
may omit its off sequence.

`0bda-5767.toml` in this directory is the complete version of the profile above,
with all five steps in each direction.

Supported `query` values are `set_cur` and `get_cur`.

Each step takes its payload from exactly one of:

- `control_bytes`, the bytes to send
- `payload`, an accepted alias for `control_bytes`
- `size`, which sends that many zero bytes and is the usual choice for a
  `get_cur` priming read

## Forcing YUY2 on the IR node

Some cameras report a pixel format on their IR node that they cannot actually
stream. Set `requires_ir_yuy2` to make Gaze pin that node to YUY2:

```toml
[device]
vendor_id        = 0x0BDA
product_id       = 0x5767
name             = "Realtek/Dell 0JCXG0 Integrated_Webcam_HD"
requires_ir_yuy2 = true
```

It defaults to `false` and applies only to the IR node, never the color node.

Gaze also has a safe runtime fallback for Microsoft Face Authentication XU controls: when no VID:PID profile exists, it probes read-only `GET_CUR` on selector `0x06` for the standard 9-byte `[1, 3, mode, 0, ...]` shape and uses `[1,3,2,0,...]`/`[1,3,1,0,...]` if found.
